## Front End

### Padwan projects
The projects should be added to a user's directory in a `projects` folder, in the following format:

```
'padwan/name'
|
|--- `padwan/name/projects`
|
|------ `padwan/name/projects/about-me/`
|
|--------- `padwan/name/projects/about-me/index.html`
```

After finish each project, it should be submitted as a Pull Request to this repository. I will then review each PR and give it feedback. Don't worry, we all started somewhere! It's all about learning.

#### #1 Project "About me"
Replace the contents of `index.html` in your directory with a small website about you and push the results to Git.
