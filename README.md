## Front End

### Padwan projects
The projects should be added to a user's directory in a `projects` folder, in the following format:

```
'padwan/name'
|
|--- `padwan/name/projects`
|
|------ `padwan/name/projects/about-me/`
|
|--------- `padwan/name/projects/about-me/index.html`
```

After finish each project, it should be submitted as a Pull Request to this repository. I will then review each PR and give it feedback. Don't worry, we all started somewhere! It's all about learning.

#### #1 Project "Initial commit"
Create a new folder inside `padwan` with your GitHub username. Create an `index.html` file in your directory with a small website about you and push the results to git (fork before and then push as a PR).
- Estimated time: 30 minutes

#### #2 Project "About me"
Create a `projects` directory with a `about-me` folder inside. Then create an `index.html` file.

File contents:
- A picture of your favourite animal
- 2 paragraphs describing it (each should have a different color)
- A YouTube video with a funny compilation of that animal
- (bonus) When clicking on the image, the page should present a prompt to the user with "Hello!". Hint: `al..`
